# Churn feature importance task
In this repository I explore different methods to find out which features are most important in the customer churn task.

There are 3 different methods, that I chose:
* using Logistic Regression
* using CatBoost Classifier
* and using Ensemble of different models (Logistic Regression, HistGradBoostTree and Naive Bayes model)
* PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method

To make this project, I was using [this](https://betterdatascience.com/feature-importance-python/) cite. It was very helpfull for me.
